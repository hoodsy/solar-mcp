Coverage notes for the nrel-solar server.

- PVWatts v8 (dataset=nsrdb): NSRDB PSM v3 TMY-2020 weather; covers the

  how far the weather cell is from the requested point; this server warns
  above 32 km.
- Solar Resource v1: Perez-SUNY/NREL 2012 model, 1998-2009 average, 0.1-degree
  (~10 km) cells, US coverage; international locations return an error.
